		<li style="margin-bottom:10px"><b>Did you change the MAC address?</b><br />
			The DHCP server probably assigned the board a new IP address, but your
			computer's network cache has saved the wrong address. From the command
			prompt in Windows, enter "nbtstat&nbsp;-R" to clear old values, then try
			the link above.</li>

			the IP address you set is not reachable. Try the step below.</li>
